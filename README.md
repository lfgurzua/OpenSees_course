# OpenSees_course
This repository contains the old OpenSees files used in our old YouTube tutorials. The videos are no longer available for the public, but the code is kept here for legacy purposes. We can give access to the old videos for engineers working on non-profit purposes (academia, NGOs, etc). For this purpose, please send an email to info@terrastruct.co.uk to request it. Please state your affiliation and gmail account to enable your access.
